# SCAN2000_breakout

This repository contains the KiCAD and Freecad project files for a breakout panel for for a Keithley SCAN2000 replacement card. It is a specific breakout board in the sense that it holds the (solid-state) relays inside, lowering the overal electrical noise.

It is supposed to be matched with the board from [here](https://github.com/hb020/SCAN2000), either directly, either via a small mezzanine driver/ESD suppression board that can be found in the [/SCAN2000_driver](/SCAN2000_driver) directory.
